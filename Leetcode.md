## Day-4  (2/7/25)
# üí∞ Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock - Simple Solution

## üéØ The Problem
Find the best day to buy and sell a stock to make maximum profit.

**Example:** `[7,1,5,3,6,4]` ‚Üí Answer: `5` (buy at 1, sell at 6)

---

## üí° Simple Strategy
1. **Remember the cheapest price** we've seen
2. **Check profit** if we sell today
3. **Keep track** of the best profit

---

## üêç Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price = prices[0]  # Cheapest price so far
        max_profit = 0         # Best profit so far
        
        for price in prices[1:]:
            min_price = min(min_price, price)      # Update cheapest
            profit = price - min_price             # Today's profit
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)   # Update best profit
        
        return max_profit
```

---

## üìä How It Works

**Array:** `[7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]`

| Day | Price | Cheapest | Profit | Best Profit |
|-----|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 0   | 7     | 7        | -      | 0           |
| 1   | 1     | 1        | 0      | 0           |
| 2   | 5     | 1        | 4      | 4           |
| 3   | 3     | 1        | 2      | 4           |
| 4   | 6     | 1        | **5**  | **5**       |
| 5   | 4     | 1        | 3      | 5           |

**Result:** Buy at $1, sell at $6 = $5 profit! üéâ

---

## ‚ö° Why This Works
- We can only sell **after** we buy
- So we track the **lowest price** up to today
- Then check: "What if I sell today?"
- Keep the **best profit** we find

**Time:** O(n) - one pass  
**Space:** O(1) - just two variables


# Day 5 - July 3, 2025

## 125. Valid Palindrome

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Two Pointers, String  
**Companies:** Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

A phrase is a **palindrome** if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward.

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a **palindrome**, or `false` otherwise.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.

---

## üí° Simple Strategy

1. **Clean the string**: Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
2. **Two pointers**: Compare characters from both ends moving inward
3. **Check match**: If all characters match, it's a palindrome!

---

## üêç Python Solutions

### Solution 1: Simple and Clean
```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # Step 1: Clean the string - keep only alphanumeric and lowercase
        cleaned = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())
        
        # Step 2: Check if cleaned string equals its reverse
        return cleaned == cleaned[::-1]
```

### Solution 2: Two Pointers (Space Efficient)
```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # Two pointers from both ends
        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            # Skip non-alphanumeric characters from left
            while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
                left += 1
            
            # Skip non-alphanumeric characters from right
            while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
                right -= 1
            
            # Compare characters (case-insensitive)
            if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
                return False
            
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        
        return True
```

### Solution 3: Step-by-Step (For Understanding)
```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # Step 1: Convert to lowercase
        s = s.lower()
        
        # Step 2: Filter only alphanumeric characters
        alphanumeric_only = ""
        for char in s:
            if char.isalnum():  # Keep letters and numbers only
                alphanumeric_only += char
        
        # Step 3: Check if string reads same forwards and backwards
        return alphanumeric_only == alphanumeric_only[::-1]
```

## üìä Step-by-Step Walkthrough

**Example:** `"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"`

### Method 1: Clean First
```
Original: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Step 1: Convert to lowercase ‚Üí "a man, a plan, a canal: panama"
Step 2: Keep only alphanumeric ‚Üí "amanaplanacanalpanama"
Step 3: Check if palindrome ‚Üí "amanaplanacanalpanama" == "amanaplanacanalpanama"
Result: True ‚úÖ
```

### Method 2: Two Pointers
```
Original: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
         ‚Üë                            ‚Üë
       left                        right

Compare: 'A' vs 'a' ‚Üí same (case-insensitive) ‚úÖ
Move pointers inward, skip non-alphanumeric...
Continue until pointers meet
Result: True ‚úÖ
```

## üîç Edge Cases

| Input | Cleaned | Result | Explanation |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `""` | `""` | `True` | Empty string is palindrome |
| `" "` | `""` | `True` | Only spaces ‚Üí empty after cleaning |
| `"a"` | `"a"` | `True` | Single character is palindrome |
| `"Aa"` | `"aa"` | `True` | Case-insensitive |
| `"ab"` | `"ab"` | `False` | Different characters |

---

## ‚ö° Complexity Analysis

| Solution | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Clean First | O(n) | O(n) |
| Two Pointers | O(n) | O(1) |
| Step-by-Step | O(n) | O(n) |

**Best Choice:** Two Pointers method for O(1) space complexity!

---

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **Preprocessing**: Clean the string by removing non-alphanumeric characters
2. **Case-insensitive**: Convert to lowercase for comparison
3. **Two approaches**: 
   - Clean first, then compare (simple but uses extra space)
   - Two pointers (more efficient, constant space)
4. **Edge cases**: Empty strings and single characters are palindromes

# Day 6 - July 4, 2025

## 136. Single Number

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Array, Bit Manipulation  
**Companies:** Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.

**Important:** You must implement a solution with linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4`
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

---

## üí° The Magic Solution: XOR

**Key Insight:** XOR has a special property:
- `a ^ a = 0` (any number XOR with itself = 0)
- `a ^ 0 = a` (any number XOR with 0 = itself)
- XOR is commutative: `a ^ b = b ^ a`

So if we XOR all numbers together, the duplicates cancel out! üéâ

---

## üêç Python Solutions

### Solution 1: XOR Magic (Optimal)
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0
        for num in nums:
            result ^= num  # XOR with each number
        return result
```

### Solution 2: One-liner XOR
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return reduce(lambda x, y: x ^ y, nums)
```

### Solution 3: Using Python's Built-in
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        from functools import reduce
        import operator
        return reduce(operator.xor, nums)
```

### Solution 4: Set Approach (Less Efficient)
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        seen = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num in seen:
                seen.remove(num)  # Remove if seen before
            else:
                seen.add(num)     # Add if first time
        return seen.pop()         # Return the only remaining element
```

---

## üîç How XOR Works

**Example:** `[4,1,2,1,2]`

```
Step by step XOR:
result = 0
result = 0 ^ 4 = 4
result = 4 ^ 1 = 5
result = 5 ^ 2 = 7
result = 7 ^ 1 = 6
result = 6 ^ 2 = 4

Final result: 4 ‚úÖ
```

**Why it works:**
```
4 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 2
= 4 ^ (1 ^ 1) ^ (2 ^ 2)  # Group duplicates
= 4 ^ 0 ^ 0              # Duplicates cancel out
= 4                      # Single number remains!
```

---

## üìä Visual Explanation

**Array:** `[2,2,1]`

| Step | Current | XOR Operation | Result |
|------|---------|---------------|---------|
| 1    | 0       | 0 ^ 2         | 2       |
| 2    | 2       | 2 ^ 2         | 0       |
| 3    | 0       | 0 ^ 1         | 1       |

**Final Answer:** 1 üéØ

---

## üß† XOR Truth Table

| A | B | A ^ B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 0     |
| 0 | 1 | 1     |
| 1 | 0 | 1     |
| 1 | 1 | 0     |

**Key Property:** `A ^ A = 0` (same bits cancel out)

---

## ‚ö° Complexity Analysis

| Solution | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| XOR Magic | O(n) | O(1) ‚úÖ |
| Set Approach | O(n) | O(n) |
| Sorting + Check | O(n log n) | O(1) |

**Winner:** XOR approach - meets all requirements perfectly!

---

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **XOR Properties:** 
   - `a ^ a = 0` (duplicates cancel)
   - `a ^ 0 = a` (identity)
   - Commutative and associative

2. **Perfect for this problem:**
   - Linear time O(n)
   - Constant space O(1)
   - Works with negative numbers too!

3. **Real-world application:** Error detection, cryptography, finding differences

def singleNumber(nums):
    count = Counter(nums)
    for num, freq in count.items():

## 1394. Find Lucky Integer in an Array

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Array, Hash Table, Counting  
**Companies:** Amazon, Microsoft, Google

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, a **lucky integer** is an integer that has a frequency in the array equal to its value.

Return *the largest ****lucky integer**** in the array*. If there is no **lucky integer** return `-1`.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [2,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The only lucky number in the array is 2 because frequency[2] == 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [1,2,2,3,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 1, 2 and 3 are all lucky numbers, return the largest of them.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: arr = [2,2,2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no lucky numbers in the array.
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= arr.length <= 500`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 500`

---

## üí° Simple Strategy

1. **Count frequency** of each number
2. **Check if number equals its frequency** (lucky condition)
3. **Return the largest** lucky number found

**Lucky condition:** `number == frequency[number]`

---

## üêç Python Solutions

### Solution 1: Simple and Clean
```python
class Solution:
    def findLucky(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        from collections import Counter
        
        # Count frequency of each number
        freq = Counter(arr)
        
        # Find all lucky numbers and return the largest
        lucky_numbers = [num for num, count in freq.items() if num == count]
        
        return max(lucky_numbers) if lucky_numbers else -1
```

### Solution 2: One Pass Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def findLucky(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        from collections import Counter
        
        freq = Counter(arr)
        max_lucky = -1
        
        # Check each number if it's lucky
        for num, count in freq.items():
            if num == count:  # Lucky condition
                max_lucky = max(max_lucky, num)
        
        return max_lucky
```

### Solution 3: Manual Counting (No Imports)
```python
class Solution:
    def findLucky(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        # Manual frequency counting
        freq = {}
        for num in arr:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        # Find largest lucky number
        max_lucky = -1
        for num, count in freq.items():
            if num == count:
                max_lucky = max(max_lucky, num)
        
        return max_lucky
```

### Solution 4: Using Dictionary with Default
```python
class Solution:
    def findLucky(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        for num in arr:
            freq[num] += 1
        
        # Find the largest lucky number
        result = -1
        for num in freq:
            if num == freq[num]:
                result = max(result, num)
        
        return result
```

## üìä Step-by-Step Walkthrough

**Example:** `[1,2,2,3,3,3]`

### Step 1: Count Frequencies
```
Number | Frequency
-------|----------
   1   |    1     ‚Üê Lucky! (1 == 1)
   2   |    2     ‚Üê Lucky! (2 == 2)  
   3   |    3     ‚Üê Lucky! (3 == 3)
```

### Step 2: Check Lucky Condition
```

2: frequency = 2 ‚Üí 2 == 2 ‚úÖ Lucky!
3: frequency = 3 ‚Üí 3 == 3 ‚úÖ Lucky!
```

### Step 3: Return Largest
```
Lucky numbers: [1, 2, 3]
Largest: 3 ‚úÖ
```

## üîç More Examples

**Example:** `[2,2,2,3,3]`

| Number | Frequency | Lucky? | Why? |
|--------|-----------|--------|------|
| 2      | 3         | ‚ùå     | 2 ‚â† 3 |
| 3      | 2         | ‚ùå     | 3 ‚â† 2 |

**Result:** -1 (no lucky numbers)

---

**Example:** `[7,7,7,7,7,7,7]`

| Number | Frequency | Lucky? | Why? |
|--------|-----------|--------|------|
| 7      | 7         | ‚úÖ     | 7 == 7 |

**Result:** 7 (the only lucky number)

---

## ‚ö° Complexity Analysis

| Solution | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Counter + List | O(n) | O(n) |
| One Pass | O(n) | O(n) |
| Manual Counting | O(n) | O(n) |

**All solutions are equally efficient!** Choose based on readability preference.

---

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **Lucky Definition:** `number == frequency[number]`
2. **Two-step process:** Count frequencies, then check lucky condition
3. **Edge case:** Return -1 if no lucky numbers exist
4. **Multiple solutions:** Counter, manual counting, or one-pass approach

---

## üß† Mental Model

Think of it as a **matching game**:
- Count how many times each number appears

# Day 8 - July 6, 2025

## 141. Linked List Cycle

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Hash Table, Linked List, Two Pointers  
**Companies:** Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Apple

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

### Constraints
- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

## üí° The Classic Solution: Floyd's Cycle Detection (Tortoise and Hare)

**Key Insight:** Use two pointers moving at different speeds:
- **Slow pointer** (tortoise): moves 1 step at a time
- **Fast pointer** (hare): moves 2 steps at a time

If there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer! üê¢üê∞

---

## üêç Python Solutions

### Solution 1: Floyd's Algorithm (Optimal)
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return False
        
        # Two pointers: slow (1 step) and fast (2 steps)
        slow = head
        fast = head.next
        
        while fast and fast.next:
            if slow == fast:  # They meet = cycle detected!
                return True
            
            slow = slow.next        # Move 1 step
            fast = fast.next.next   # Move 2 steps
        
        return False  # Reached end = no cycle
```

### Solution 2: Cleaner Floyd's Algorithm
```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow = fast = head
        
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next        # 1 step
            fast = fast.next.next   # 2 steps
            
            if slow == fast:        # Meeting point = cycle!
                return True
        
        return False
```

### Solution 3: Using Hash Set (Less Efficient)
```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        visited = set()
        
        current = head
        while current:
            if current in visited:  # Already seen this node
                return True
            
            visited.add(current)
            current = current.next
        
        return False
```

### Solution 4: Node Modification (Tricky)
```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        while head:
            if head.val == float('inf'):  # Already visited
                return True
            
            head.val = float('inf')  # Mark as visited
            head = head.next
        
        return False
```

## üîç How Floyd's Algorithm Works

**Visual Example:** `[3,2,0,-4]` with cycle at position 1

```
Initial: 3 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 0 ‚Üí -4
              ‚Üë_______|

Step 1: slow=3, fast=2
Step 2: slow=2, fast=-4  
Step 3: slow=0, fast=2
Step 4: slow=-4, fast=0
Step 5: slow=2, fast=-4
Step 6: slow=0, fast=2
Step 7: slow=-4, fast=0
Step 8: slow=2, fast=-4
Step 9: slow=0, fast=2   ‚Üê They meet! Cycle detected! üéØ
```

---

## üìä Step-by-Step Walkthrough

**Example:** `[1,2]` with pos = 0 (cycle: 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 1)

| Step | Slow | Fast | Meet? |
|------|------|------|-------|
| 0    | 1    | 1    | Same start |
| 1    | 2    | 2    | ‚úÖ Meet! |

**Result:** True (cycle detected)

---

## üß† Why Floyd's Algorithm Works

**Mathematical Proof:**
- If there's a cycle, both pointers will eventually enter it
- Inside the cycle, fast pointer gains 1 position per step on slow pointer
- Since cycle is finite, fast will eventually catch slow
- If no cycle, fast pointer reaches end (null)

**Analogy:** Think of a circular race track üèÅ
- Slow runner: 1 lap per hour
- Fast runner: 2 laps per hour
- Eventually, fast runner will "lap" the slow runner!

## ‚ö° Complexity Analysis

| Solution | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Floyd's Algorithm | O(n) | O(1) ‚úÖ |
| Hash Set | O(n) | O(n) |
| Node Modification | O(n) | O(1) |

**Winner:** Floyd's Algorithm - optimal in both time and space!

---

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **Two-pointer technique:** Classic approach for cycle detection
2. **Speed difference:** Fast pointer moves 2x faster than slow
3. **Meeting point:** If they meet, there's definitely a cycle
4. **Edge cases:** Empty list, single node, no cycle
5. **Space efficient:** O(1) space complexity

---

## üîç Edge Cases

```python
# Empty list
head = None ‚Üí False

# Single node, no cycle
head = [1] ‚Üí False

# Single node, self-cycle
head = [1] ‚Üí True (if pos = 0)

# Two nodes, no cycle
head = [1,2] ‚Üí False

# Two nodes, cycle
head = [1,2] with pos = 0 ‚Üí True
```

---

## üí≠ Alternative Approaches

```python
# Using try-catch (creative but not recommended)
def hasCycle(head):
    try:
        slow = head
        fast = head.next
        while slow is not fast:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return True
    except:
        return False

# Using recursion (not space efficient)
def hasCycle(head, visited=None):
    if not head:
        return False
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    if head in visited:
        return True
    visited.add(head)
    return hasCycle(head.next, visited)

# Day 9 - July 7, 2025

## 1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topics:** Array, Greedy, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue)  
**Companies:** Google, Microsoft, Amazon

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

You are given an array of events where `events[i] = [startDay, endDay]`. Every event i starts at `startDay` and ends at `endDay`.

You can attend an event i at any day d where `startDay <= d <= endDay`. You can only attend one event at any time d.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
One way to attend them all is as shown.
Attend the first event on day 1.
Attend the second event on day 2.
Attend the third event on day 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can attend all four events by attending them optimally.
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= events.length <= 10^5`
- `events[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= startDay <= endDay <= 10^5`

---

## üí° Greedy Strategy

**Key Insight:** Always attend the event that ends earliest among available events on each day.

**Why?** Events that end sooner have fewer opportunities to be attended later, so we should prioritize them.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. **Sort events** by start day
2. **For each day**, collect all events that start on that day
3. **Remove expired events** from consideration
4. **Attend the event that ends earliest** (greedy choice)

---

## üêç Python Solutions

### Solution 1: Greedy with Heap (Optimal)
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def maxEvents(self, events: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Sort events by start day
        events.sort()
        
        min_heap = []  # Store end days of available events
        day = 1
        event_idx = 0
        attended = 0
        
        # Continue until no more events to process
        while event_idx < len(events) or min_heap:
            # Add all events that start on current day
            while event_idx < len(events) and events[event_idx][0] == day:
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, events[event_idx][1])  # Add end day
                event_idx += 1
            
            # Remove expired events (ended before current day)
            while min_heap and min_heap[0] < day:
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            
            # Attend the event that ends earliest
            if min_heap:
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)  # Attend this event
                attended += 1
            
            day += 1
        
        return attended
```

### Solution 2: Cleaner Implementation
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def maxEvents(self, events: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        events.sort()  # Sort by start day
        heap = []
        i = attended = day = 0
        
        while i < len(events) or heap:
            # If no events available today, jump to next event start
            if not heap:
                day = events[i][0]
            
            # Add all events starting today
            while i < len(events) and events[i][0] == day:
                heapq.heappush(heap, events[i][1])
                i += 1
            
            # Remove expired events
            while heap and heap[0] < day:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
            
            # Attend earliest ending event
            if heap:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
                attended += 1
            
            day += 1
        
        return attended
```

### Solution 3: Alternative with Set (Less Efficient)
```python
class Solution:
    def maxEvents(self, events: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Sort events by end day (earliest deadline first)
        events.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        
        attended_days = set()
        
        for start, end in events:
            # Try to attend on the earliest available day
            for day in range(start, end + 1):
                if day not in attended_days:
                    attended_days.add(day)
                    break
        
        return len(attended_days)
```

---

## üìä Step-by-Step Walkthrough

**Example:** `events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]`

### Step 1: Sort by start day
```
Original: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
Sorted:   [[1,2],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
```

### Step 2: Process day by day

| Day | Events Starting | Available Events (heap) | Action | Attended |
|-----|-----------------|------------------------|---------|----------|
| 1   | [1,2], [1,2]   | [2, 2]                | Attend event ending day 2 | 1 |
| 2   | [2,3]          | [2, 3]                | Attend event ending day 2 | 2 |
| 3   | [3,4]          | [3, 4]                | Attend event ending day 3 | 3 |
| 4   | -              | [4]                   | Attend event ending day 4 | 4 |

**Result:** 4 events attended! ‚úÖ

---

## üîç Why Greedy Works

**Intuition:** Events with earlier end dates have fewer opportunities to be attended.

**Example:** Consider events `[1,2]` and `[1,5]`
- Event `[1,2]` can only be attended on day 1 or 2
- Event `[1,5]` can be attended on days 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5
- **Greedy choice:** Attend `[1,2]` first (more urgent)

**Proof:** If we can attend event A that ends earlier instead of event B that ends later, this choice never makes the solution worse.

---

## üß† Visual Example

```
Events: [[1,3],[2,4],[3,5]]

Day 1: Available [1,3] ‚Üí Attend [1,3]
Day 2: Available [2,4] ‚Üí Attend [2,4]  
Day 3: Available [3,5] ‚Üí Attend [3,5]

Result: 3 events attended
```

---

## ‚ö° Complexity Analysis

| Solution | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Greedy + Heap | O(n log n) | O(n) |
| Sort by End Day | O(n¬≤) | O(n) |
| Brute Force | O(n √ó max_day) | O(n) |

**Winner:** Greedy with Heap - optimal performance!

---

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **Greedy Strategy:** Always choose the event that ends earliest
2. **Heap Usage:** Efficiently find the earliest ending event
3. **Day-by-day Processing:** Simulate attending events chronologically
4. **Remove Expired:** Clean up events that can no longer be attended
5. **Sorting:** Process events in chronological order of start times

---

## üîç Edge Cases

```python
# Single event
events = [[1,1]] ‚Üí 1

# Non-overlapping events
events = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]] ‚Üí 3

# All events same period
events = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]] ‚Üí 2 (can only attend 2 days)

# No events
events = [] ‚Üí 0
```

---

## üí≠ Alternative Approaches

```python
# Sort by end day first (simpler but less efficient)
def maxEvents(events):
    events.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by end day
    used_days = set()
    
    for start, end in events:

                used_days.add(day)
                break

## 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Stack, Tree, Depth-First Search, Binary Tree  
**Companies:** Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the preorder traversal of its nodes' values*.

**Preorder Traversal:** Root ‚Üí Left ‚Üí Right

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]

Tree:
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,8,null,null,6,7,9]
Output: [1,2,4,5,6,7,3,8,9]

Tree:
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \   \
   4   5   8
      / \   \
     6   7   9
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

---

## üí° Understanding Preorder Traversal

**Order:** Root ‚Üí Left Subtree ‚Üí Right Subtree

**Memory Trick:** **"Pre"** means we process the root **before** its children!

```
For any node:
1. Process current node (add to result)
2. Traverse left subtree
3. Traverse right subtree
```

## üêç Python Solutions

### Solution 1: Recursive (Simple & Clean)
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.

```

### Recursive Approach:
```
1. Visit 1 ‚Üí result = [1]
2. Go left to 2 ‚Üí result = [1,2]
3. Go left to 4 ‚Üí result = [1,2,4]
4. 4 has no children, return
5. Go right to 5 ‚Üí result = [1,2,4,5]
6. 5 has no children, return
7. Go right to 3 ‚Üí result = [1,2,4,5,3]
8. 3 has no children, return

Final: [1,2,4,5,3]
```

### Iterative Approach:
```
Stack: [1]
Pop 1, add to result: [1]
Push right(3), left(2): Stack = [3,2]

Stack: [3,2]
Pop 2, add to result: [1,2]
Push right(5), left(4): Stack = [3,5,4]

Stack: [3,5,4]
Pop 4, add to result: [1,2,4]
No children: Stack = [3,5]

Stack: [3,5]
Pop 5, add to result: [1,2,4,5]
No children: Stack = [3]

2. **Recursive is natural:** Matches the definition perfectly
3. **Stack simulates recursion:** LIFO order, push right then left
4. **Morris is advanced:** O(1) space using tree restructuring
5. **Foundation for DFS:** Many tree problems use preorder traversal

# Day 11 - September 7, 2025

## Reschedule Meetings for Maximum Free Time I

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topics:** Array, Sliding Window, Greedy  
**Companies:** Google, Microsoft, Amazon

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

Given an event duration `eventTime`, meetings schedule (`startTime`, `endTime`), and `k` allowed reschedules, maximize the longest continuous free time by moving at most `k` meetings while maintaining their order and non-overlapping nature.

**Constraints:**
- 1 ‚â§ eventTime ‚â§ 10‚Åπ
- 2 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ n
- Meetings are initially non-overlapping and ordered

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: eventTime=5, k=1, startTime=[1,3], endTime=[2,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: Move first meeting to [2,3], creating free time [0,2]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: eventTime=10, k=1, startTime=[0,2,9], endTime=[1,4,10]
Output: 6
Explanation: Move second meeting to [1,3], creating free time [3,9]
```

---

## üí° Sliding Window Strategy

**Key Insight:** By rescheduling at most `k` meetings, we can merge up to `k+1` consecutive gaps between meetings.

**Why?** When we move a meeting, we eliminate the gap after it and potentially create a larger continuous gap by merging adjacent free time periods.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. **Calculate all gaps** between meetings (including before first and after last)
2. **Use sliding window** to find the maximum sum of `k+1` consecutive gaps
3. **Return the maximum** free time achievable

---

## üêç Python Solution

### Optimal Solution: Sliding Window
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxFreeTime(self, eventTime: int, k: int, startTime: List[int], endTime: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(startTime)
        
        # Calculate all gaps
        gaps = []
        # Gap before first meeting
        gaps.append(startTime[0] - 0)
        # Gaps between meetings
        for i in range(1, n):
            gaps.append(startTime[i] - endTime[i-1])
        # Gap after last meeting
        gaps.append(eventTime - endTime[-1])

        # We can merge up to k gaps ‚Üí sum of (k+1) consecutive gaps is candidate
        window_size = k + 1
        
        # Sliding window to find max sum of window_size consecutive gaps
        max_free_time = 0
        window_sum = sum(gaps[:window_size])
        max_free_time = window_sum
        
        for i in range(window_size, len(gaps)):
            window_sum += gaps[i] - gaps[i - window_size]
            if window_sum > max_free_time:
                max_free_time = window_sum
        
        return max_free_time
```

---

## üìä Step-by-Step Walkthrough

**Example:** `eventTime=10, k=1, startTime=[0,2,9], endTime=[1,4,10]`

### Step 1: Calculate gaps
```
Meetings: [0,1], [2,4], [9,10]
Gap before first: 0 - 0 = 0
Gap between 1st and 2nd: 2 - 1 = 1  
Gap between 2nd and 3rd: 9 - 4 = 5
Gap after last: 10 - 10 = 0
Gaps: [0, 1, 5, 0]
```

### Step 2: Sliding window (k+1 = 2 consecutive gaps)
```
Window [0, 1]: sum = 1
Window [1, 5]: sum = 6  ‚Üê Maximum!
Window [5, 0]: sum = 5
```

### Step 3: Result
```
Maximum free time = 6
Achieved by moving the second meeting to create gap [3,9]
```

---

## üîç Why This Works

**Intuition:** When we reschedule `k` meetings, we can eliminate `k` gaps and merge the remaining gaps around them.

**Key Points:**
1. **Gap elimination:** Moving a meeting removes the gap after it
2. **Gap merging:** Adjacent gaps can be combined into larger continuous free time
3. **Optimal choice:** We want to merge the largest possible gaps

---

## ‚ö° Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - O(n) to calculate gaps
  - O(n) for sliding window
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - O(n) for storing gaps array

---

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **Gap thinking:** Convert meeting scheduling to gap maximization problem
2. **Sliding window:** Efficiently find maximum sum of consecutive elements
3. **Greedy insight:** Merging largest gaps gives optimal result
4. **Edge cases:** Handle meetings at boundaries (start/end of event time)

---

## üîç Edge Cases

```python
# Only two meetings
eventTime=5, k=1, startTime=[0,3], endTime=[1,4] ‚Üí Output: 2

# Can reschedule all meetings  
eventTime=10, k=3, startTime=[1,3,5], endTime=[2,4,6] ‚Üí Output: 10

# No rescheduling needed
eventTime=10, k=0, startTime=[0,5], endTime=[1,6] ‚Üí Output: 4

# Single large gap
eventTime=20, k=1, startTime=[0,15], endTime=[5,20] ‚Üí Output: 15
```

- 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons  
- 1326. Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden

2. **Mention sliding window** - efficient way to find maximum sum
3. **Walk through example** - show gap calculation and window movement
4. **Discuss edge cases** - boundary meetings, extreme k values

Binary Tree Postorder Traversal
Date: 10/7/25
Day: 12

Problem Description
Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Postorder traversal means:

Traverse the left subtree

Traverse the right subtree

Visit the root node

Examples
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3, 2, 1]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,8,null,null,6,7,9]
Output: [4,6,7,5,2,9,8,3,1]

Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Example 4:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

Constraints
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].

Node values are between -100 and 100.

Explanation
Postorder traversal means we visit nodes in the order: left child, right child, then the node itself.

A recursive solution is straightforward, but the problem asks if you can do it iteratively (without recursion).

Python Solutions
Recursive Solution (Simple)
python
Copy
from typing import List, Optional

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def postorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        if not root:
            return []
        return self.postorderTraversal(root.left) + self.postorderTraversal(root.right) + [root.val],

# Day 13: Excel Sheet Column Title (11/7/25)

## Problem Statement
Convert a given integer to its corresponding Excel column title (1 ‚Üí "A", 28 ‚Üí "AB", etc.).

**Constraints:**

## Examples

Input: 1 ‚Üí Output: "A"
Input: 28 ‚Üí Output: "AB"
Input: 701 ‚Üí Output: "ZY"

## Solution Approach
Base-26 Conversion with Adjustment
- Treat the numbering as base-26 but with A=1 instead of A=0
- Repeatedly divide by 26 and get remainders
- Adjust remainders to map to A-Z (1-26)
- Build the string in reverse order

```python
class Solution:
    def convertToTitle(self, columnNumber: int) -> str:
        result = []
        while columnNumber > 0:
            columnNumber -= 1  # Adjust to 0-based
            remainder = columnNumber % 26
            result.append(chr(65 + remainder))  # 65 = 'A'
            columnNumber //= 26
        return ''.join(reversed(result))
```

Input: "AB" ‚Üí 28
Input: "ZY" ‚Üí 701


class Solution:
    def titleToNumber(self, columnTitle: str) -> int:
        result = 0
